## Installation 
Before installing, please make sure you have node.js installed locally. If you don't already have node.js, you can download it via their [website](https://nodejs.dev/). After cloning this repo, open the integrated terminal in VS Code & install the necessary npm packages. A package.json file already exists with listed dependencies, so you can simply enter "npm install" to acquire the packages. Custom scripts are included, so you can complete database setup, seeds, and sync with the following commands: 

* npm run resetdb  - this will create the database through the mySQL shell without navigating through the terminal. Enter your password to continue to the next step. 

* npm run seed  - this will seed the database.

* npm start  - this will initiate CRUD functionality & start the server.

## Usage
Walkthrough Video: [ORM_E-Commerce_Back_End](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Z8C_9THepQ6yNYfs3vfN8_jO-fJirSU/view?usp=sharing). 

Currently, users will need to enter specific URL pathways in order to use the application. In further development, I plan to incorporate a front-end user interface which allows users to complete CRUD functions with visual representations & forms via their web browser.
